I am currently working under the umbrella of ARPA-E funded project named â€œDEEPER". DEEPER is integrative platform aimed to identify deeper root phenes 
								for maize. Under this project, I get to work on several interesting topics related to soil science, genetics, plant physiology, and modeling (RootSlice).
								 But I am primarily focused on discovering new root phenes that could improve plant performance under drought and/or nitrogen stress conditions. 
								 Among other topics, I am testing the utility of having long root hairs under drought stress.

									I am also working to identify phenes that could lead to overall metabolically cheap root systems. Maintaining roots is expensive, as on an average plants spend
									one-third of their photosynthates on producing and maintaining roots. Our lab has identified a number of anatomical phenes like cortical cell file
									number, cell size, and aerenchyma area which help in reducing the metabolic burden. I am moving a step deeper by looking at organelle level to explore 
									the variation in different subcellular organelles like vacuole size, and peroxisomes per cell. 
									I am then incorporating this information into a new root anatomy model - RootSlice to better understand the underlying mechanisms.

								During my masters, I worked with a winter wheat breeding program at SDSU and did several projects on GWAS and population genetics of multiple 
								important diseases. One of the projects that got me interested in studying plant roots was on wheat-diazotrophic interactions. In this project 
								we found that wild species of wheat were able to interact better with diazotrophs as compared to their modern companions.
